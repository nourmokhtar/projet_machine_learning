This project applies machine learning and association rule mining techniques to medical data for predictive analytics, diagnosis support, and pattern discovery.
It combines classification, regression, and Apriori-based association rules, enhanced with Power BI dashboards for dynamic healthcare insights.
The application is deployed via Streamlit for real-time interaction.
